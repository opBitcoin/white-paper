**STRONG ROOTS**

opBitcoin is a fork of 0xBitcoin launched on the Ethereum network from 2018 learn more and support the OG here:

**ERC20 COMPATABLE**

opBitcoin is the triple threat taking the great aspects of 0xbitcoin, Ethereum, & Bitcoin and making it mineable on a chain with much cheaper fees, this will make mining and trading much more accessable to everyday users. By default opBitcoin works with all defi exhancges and protocals and can be traded p2p with anyone in the world. 



<br>

**HOW TO MINE**

opBitcoin uses a simple Keccak256 (Sha3) algorithm using the following methodology:

``keccak256(nonce, minerEthAddress, challengeNumber) < difficultyTarget``


We have built a custom python miner that can be used at launch to solo mine and are developing tools to mine as a pool, we will also encourage the community to build and tools that can be used for the protocal.

**FAQ**

*Does opBitcoin have its own Blockchain?*

> No.


*Why are there times when a lot of mints get reverted?*

> If difficulty is low compared to over hashrate and multiple valid solutions were submitted to the contract in a very short amount of time only the first will be selected.

*How does pool mining work with opBitcoin?*

> The same way that pool mining works for classic Bitcoin, except opBitcoin pools must pay gas fees to the Optimistic network.

*How does the difficulty update?*

> Difficulty auto-updates during every 10th block that is mined.

*Will there be a reward halvening event and when?*

> Yes, every 210000 mints.
